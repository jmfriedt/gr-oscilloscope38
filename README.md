# gr-oscilloscope38
Using an oscilloscope as Software Defined Radio source for GNU Radio 3.8

Assumes the availability of RPC for communication over VXI11 with an oscilloscope.
Tested on Rohde & Schwarz RTO2034 and RTE1054, will most probably work on any RT series
oscilloscopes. Origianlly developed for the Agilent 54855DSO but not tested after
adding support for R&S instruments. Select which brand is used with the #define flags
in the lib/ directory source code (#define rohdeschwarz is exclusive with #define agilent).

For those wanting to test gr-oscilloscope with no hardware access, a TCP server generating
dummy data (sine waves) is available in examples. Compile manually (gcc -o tcp_server 
tcp_server.c -lm) and execute (./examples/tcp_server) to connect the server to port 9999 of
the localhost. TCP/IP dummy data communication is activated by selecting as IP address
of the gr-oscilloscope ``oscilloscope'' block 127.0.0.1.
